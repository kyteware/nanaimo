    = help: the trait `std::fmt::Debug` is not implemented for `<B as InputBackend>::PointerAxisEvent`
    = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__macro_support::format_args` which comes from the expansion of the macro `tracing::trace` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider further restricting the associated type
